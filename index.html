            <h1>About Mold</h1>
            <p>Mold can grow any place where conditions are permissible. Mold requires two things in order cultivate:
            moisture and a source of nutrients; anything can serve as a source of nutrients, from drywall (sheetrock), 
            insulation, carpet, to mattresses. Moisture can be caused by many factors, such as elevated levels of humidity due to
            A/C malfunctions, leaky water lines, broken electro-domestics;&lsquo water supply, roof leak, sewer backup, faulty plumbing, etc.
            It is recommended that the mold be evaluated and removed by a certified specialist because removing mold, even in small spaces,
            an create a larger problem by causing the spores to spread the through the entirety of the home. Due to this, when we do the mold restorations, 
            we isolate the contaminated space(s) and use equipment that filters the air to a 99.9% effectiveness.</p>
